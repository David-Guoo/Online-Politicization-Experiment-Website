## 1. Changes of Experiment Settings
- We've shifted the question asking the participant to label his/her ideology from the beginning to the end of the experiment.
- We've changed one alteration of the prediction question.
  - Original: *"Consider a scenario where there are two strategies to save humanity from extinction: Plan A involves expanding human life into outer space, while Plan B focuses on transitioning human existence into virtual reality. In this context, I would favor Plan A over Plan B."*
  - New: *"In the realm of scientific advancement, it's more crucial to channel efforts and resources into space exploration rather than the development of virtual reality technology."*
  
## 2. Results
This time 160 participants were engaged in the Pilot 2 Experiment, 156 valid data points were collected. The rmse of the ideology labeled by a participant himself and his/her ideology registered on Connect is 0.68, which is **acceptable**.


### 2.1 Answer Pattern of Each Question
![Ideology-Answer Plots](../visualization/2024_01_25-pilot_2-questions.jpg)

- The correlation of ideology and answer for almost all questions diminishes after repositioning the ideology question.
- The hard fact question that asked about the population growth rate of California has a relatively high correlation, and we may consider replacing it with another one.

| A3 | 0.74 | 0.42 |      | 0.49 |
| A4 | 0.60 | 0.41 | 0.49 |      |

Spearman Correlation:

|    |   A1 |   A2 |   A3 |   A4 |
|:---|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| A1 |      | 0.44 | 0.75 | 0.59 |
| A2 | 0.44 |      | 0.41 | 0.41 |
| A3 | 0.75 | 0.41 |      | 0.47 |
| A4 | 0.59 | 0.41 | 0.47 |      |


*(Pearson correlation is usually used to measure linear relationship, and it assumes variables to be normally distributed. Spearman correlation measures non-linear relationship and doesn't assume normality or linearity.)*

For the prediction question, (A1, A3) can be regarded as a good pair. For the issue question, (A1, A3) is a good pair. More questions need to be posed and tried.

### 2.3 Scatter Plots of Answers

We draw the scatter plots of answers for each pair of questions. As all questions have an answer range of [-3, 3], we normalize the answers of each question by calculating $x'=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$, where $\mu$ is the mean answer and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Then $x'$ is clipped to [-3, 3] to fit the answer range.

![scatter_rescaled_true](../visualization/2024_01_25-pilot_2-scatter_rescaled_True.jpg)

- Rescaling doesn't make any difference on the slopes of the regression lines.
- All slopes have a value smaller than 1, which is an interesting pattern.

### 2.4 PCA analysis

We extract one principal component using PCA for prediction question group and controversial issue question group respectively (each has 4 questions). The generated two values can be used to represent the **general** opinions of that participant to these two groups of questions. Proportion of variance explained by the extracted component is listed below. 


| | Prediction | Controversial Issue |
| --- | -- | -- |
| Not Rescaled | 0.56 | 0.65 |
| Rescaled | 0.55 | 0.64 |

If we only consider the A1 and A3 of the prediction group, and the A1 and A3 of the issue group:

| | Prediction | Controversial Issue |
| --- | -- | -- |
| Not Rescaled | 0.83 | 0.87 |
| Rescaled | 0.83 | 0.87 |
